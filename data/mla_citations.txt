MLA CITATION GUIDE - Purdue OWL

MLA (Modern Language Association) style is most commonly used in the humanities, especially in writing on language and literature.

GENERAL FORMAT

MLA papers should use:
- Standard 8.5" x 11" paper
- 1-inch margins on all sides
- A legible font (e.g., 12 pt. Times New Roman)
- Double-spacing throughout
- A header with your last name and page number in the upper right corner

First Page Setup:
- Your name
- Instructor's name
- Course name
- Date (Day Month Year format)
- Centered title (no bold, underline, or italics unless required)

IN-TEXT CITATIONS

MLA uses author-page style for in-text citations. Include the author's last name and page number(s) in parentheses.

Basic format: (Author Page)

Examples:
- According to Smith, "writing is essential" (45).
- "Writing is essential" (Smith 45).
- The author argues that writing matters (Smith 45-47).

No Author:
Use a shortened version of the title: ("Article Title" 45)

Multiple Authors:
- Two authors: (Smith and Jones 45)
- Three or more authors: (Smith et al. 45)

WORKS CITED PAGE

The Works Cited page appears at the end of your paper and lists all sources cited.

General Rules:
- Start on a new page
- Title it "Works Cited" (centered, not bold)
- Double-space all entries
- Use a hanging indent (first line flush left, subsequent lines indented 0.5")

FORMATTING TIPS

1. Italicize titles of books, journals, websites, and other standalone works.
2. Use quotation marks for titles of articles, chapters, and other shorter works.
3. Use title case for all titles (capitalize major words).
4. Include URLs without "http://" or "https://" unless needed for clarity.
5. Abbreviate months longer than four letters (Jan., Feb., Mar., Apr., Aug., Sept., Oct., Nov., Dec.).
6. Use "p." for one page and "pp." for multiple pages.

COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

1. Using a period instead of a comma after container titles
2. Forgetting the hanging indent
3. Putting URLs in angle brackets (no longer required)
4. Using incorrect date format (MLA uses Day Month Year)
5. Not matching in-text citations with Works Cited entries
6. Forgetting to italicize or use quotation marks for titles
