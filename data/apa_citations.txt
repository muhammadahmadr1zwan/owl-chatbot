APA CITATION GUIDE - Purdue OWL

APA (American Psychological Association) style is most commonly used in the social sciences, education, and psychology fields.

GENERAL FORMAT

APA papers should be typed, double-spaced on standard-sized paper (8.5" x 11") with 1" margins on all sides. Use a clear font like 12 pt. Times New Roman or 11 pt. Arial. Include a page header (running head) at the top of every page.

IN-TEXT CITATIONS

APA uses an author-date citation system. After a quote or paraphrase, include the author's last name and year of publication in parentheses.

Basic format: (Author, Year)
With page number for direct quotes: (Author, Year, p. X)

Examples:
- According to Smith (2020), writing is essential.
- Writing is essential (Smith, 2020).
- "Writing is the foundation of communication" (Smith, 2020, p. 45).

Multiple Authors:
- Two authors: (Smith & Jones, 2020)
- Three or more authors: (Smith et al., 2020)

REFERENCE LIST

The reference list appears at the end of your paper. It provides full publication information for all sources cited in the text.

General Rules:
- Start the reference list on a new page
- Title it "References" (centered, bold)
- Double-space all entries
- Use a hanging indent (first line flush left, subsequent lines indented 0.5")
- Alphabetize by author's last name

TIPS FOR APA FORMATTING

1. Always include a DOI (Digital Object Identifier) when available for journal articles.
2. Use sentence case for titles (capitalize only the first word and proper nouns).
3. Italicize titles of books, journals, and other standalone works.
4. Do not italicize article or chapter titles.
5. Include retrieval dates only for sources that may change over time.
6. When in doubt, provide more information rather than less.

COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

1. Forgetting the hanging indent in references
2. Using title case instead of sentence case
3. Missing the period at the end of reference entries
4. Inconsistent formatting between similar source types
5. Not matching in-text citations with reference list entries
