WHEN TO USE EMAIL

- Documentation purposes

Consider alternatives when:

EMAIL STRUCTURE

A professional email contains these key components:

1. Subject Line
2. Salutation/Greeting
3. Opening
4. Body
5. Closing
6. Signature

SUBJECT LINE BEST PRACTICES

The subject line should be clear, specific, and concise.

Good Examples:
- "Meeting Request: Project Review - March 15"
- "Question about Assignment 3 Due Date"
- "Follow-up: Interview on Tuesday"

Avoid:
- Vague subjects like "Question" or "Help"
- ALL CAPS (appears aggressive)
- Leaving the subject blank
- Overly long subject lines

SALUTATIONS AND GREETINGS

Professional Options:

- Dear Dr. Johnson,
- Dear Mr./Ms./Mx. Williams,
- Hello Dr. Smith,
- Good morning/afternoon,

For Unknown Recipients:

- Dear Admissions Committee,
- To Whom It May Concern, (use sparingly)

Informal (for colleagues you know well):

- Hello,

EMAIL BODY STRUCTURE

Opening:
Start with the purpose of your email. Get to the point quickly.

Examples:
- "I am writing to inquire about..."
- "I wanted to follow up on our conversation about..."
- "Thank you for meeting with me yesterday. I wanted to..."

Middle:
Provide necessary details and context. Use short paragraphs (2-4 sentences). Use bullet points for lists or multiple items.

Closing:
End with a clear call to action or next steps.

Examples:
- "Please let me know if you have any questions."
- "I would appreciate a response by Friday, March 20."
- "Would you be available to meet next week?"

TONE AND LANGUAGE

Do:
- Use a professional, courteous tone
- Be concise but not abrupt
- Proofread before sending
- Use complete sentences
- Be specific about requests and deadlines

Avoid:
- Slang or casual abbreviations (lol, btw, u)

EMAILING PROFESSORS

Opening your email:
- Use their correct title (Professor, Dr., etc.)
- If unsure, "Professor" is usually safe
- Include your course name and section

Include:
- What you've already tried to solve the issue
- Specific questions rather than vague requests
- A clear ask or request

Example:
Subject: Question about Essay 2 - ENGL 106, Section 12

Dear Professor Smith,

I am a student in your ENGL 106 class, Section 12, that meets on Tuesday and Thursday at 10:30 AM.

I have a question about the second essay assignment. The prompt mentions using "at least three scholarly sources," and I wanted to clarify whether newspaper articles count as scholarly sources. I checked the syllabus and course materials but could not find a clear answer.

Could you please clarify this requirement? I want to make sure I'm meeting the assignment guidelines.

Thank you for your time.

Best regards,
Jane Doe

REPLY AND RESPONSE ETIQUETTE

Response Time:
- Respond within 24-48 hours when possible

- Only when everyone needs to see your response
- Never use for "Thank you" to large groups

Forwarding:
- Ask permission before forwarding sensitive information
- Remove unnecessary email chains
- Add context when forwarding

COMMON EMAIL MISTAKES

4. Sending while emotional (draft it, wait, review, then send)
