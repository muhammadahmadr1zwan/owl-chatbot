# owl-chatbot

Our project is to build a prototype chatbot that helps students find and understand Purdue OWL writing resources more easily. Instead of searching through many pages, students can ask the chatbot questions about writing and get quick guidance that points them to the right OWL information.

The chatbot will be built in Python and kept simple and flexible. It will be able to answer general writing questions and help users navigate OWL materials. By the end of the project, we will have a working chatbot prototype and short documentation explaining how it works and what it can do. The project is manageable within a semester and focuses on building a useful tool that supports students with their writing.
